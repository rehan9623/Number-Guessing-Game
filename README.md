# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple **Python number guessing game**.  
The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**, and the user has to guess it.

After every guess, the program tells whether the number should be **higher or lower**.  
When the correct number is guessed, it shows the total attempts and a winning percentage.
